# BioCalculator

### VISITING OUR DEPLOYED TRIAL SITE

We are creating a calculator for common biology lab experiments. The beta version of our website is [here](https://tommyfuu-biocalculator.zeet.app/), or you can access via the url below:
**https://tommyfuu-biocalculator.zeet.app/**

### 0. Notes for the developers

Starting from 6/15/2021, please start to commit your changes to the `development` branch instead of the main branch! The main branch has been synced with the deployed website so any changes made there will be reflected on the actual website. Make sure that the things function before merging things into the main branch :)

### 1. Calculator Implementation (Last updated Oct 8, 2021)

- Unit conversion, concentration change calculators completed.
- Cutting reaction being implemented and tested.
- PCR calculator being implemented: basic functionalities implemented, waiting to be refined; output not rendered.
- Colony counter being implemented: user input take-in completed; implementing algorithm.
- AR Opentron web interface being implemented.

### 2. Website general

- General aesthetics upgraded since the first iteration:
  - More simplistic design with HMC school color scheme and nicely rendered fonts.
  - Bootstrap to improve code cleanness.
- The website is currently synced using the zeet app.

### 3. Goal

- Next iteration (major upgrade, planned December 2021) of the website will include
  - Fully functional cutting reaction calculator.
  - Fully functional colony counter.
