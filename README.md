# BioCalculator

### VISITING OUR DEPLOYED TRIAL SITE

We are creating a calculator for common biology lab experiments. The beta version of our website is [here](https://tommyfuu-biocalculator.zeet.app/), or you can access via the url below:

### 0. Notes for the developers

Starting from 6/15/2021, please start to commit your changes to the `development` branch instead of the main branch! The main branch has been synced with the deployed website so any changes made there will be reflected on the actual website. Make sure that the things function before merging things into the main branch :)

### 1. Calculator Implementation

- Concentration change calculator completed.
- Deployment completed and tested, ready to be deployed when needed.
- Unit conversion being tested and bug fixing.
- Cutting reaction being implemented and tested.
- PCR calculator being implemented: basic functionalities implemented, waiting to be refined; output not rendered.

### 2. Website general

- Aesthetics to be improved.

### 3. Goal

- First iteration including fully functioning concentration-change calculator and cutting reaction calculator are to be deployed on July 11, 2021.
